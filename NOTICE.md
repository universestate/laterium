Pawn is a scripting language system consisting of a compiler and an abstract
machine, for building and running programs in the Pawn language. The Pawn
system is copyright (c) ITB CompuPhase, 1997-2017.

This work is based in part on the "Small C Compiler" by Ron Cain and
James E. Hendrix, as published in the book "Dr. Dobb's Toolbook of C",
Brady Books, 1986. Ron Cain and James Hendrix contributed their work to the
public domain, provided that the original authors are credited for their work.

The assembler version of the abstract machine was written by Marc Peter.
Marc holds the copyright of the file AMXEXEC.ASM, and it is distributed under
a simplified (and very liberal) BSD-style license.

The Just-In-Time compiler (JIT) included in this release was also written by
Marc Peter. As is apparent from the source code, the JIT is an evolutionary
step from his earlier abstract machine. The JIT falls under the same simplified
BSD-style license as the above-mentioned assembler core.

G.W.M. Vissers translated Marc Peter's JIT to NASM. This makes the JIT available
to Linux and Unix-like platforms. Mr. Vissers kept the simplified BSD-style
license of Marc Peter for his port.

The Pawn IDE is based on wxWidgets and it includes the Scintilla text editing
control. Furthermore, the Pawn IDE uses tinyxml2 from Lee Thomason
(www.grinninglizard.com). This library is distributed under the zlib license.

The "binreloc" files come from the "autopackage" project. The binreloc module
lets a Linux/Unix application find its root path, and thereby become independent
of a particular installation location. Binreloc is written by Hongli Lai, who
put the source code in the public domain.

The "stategraph" utility of the Pawn suite uses the ezXML library. The ezXML
library is copyright 2004-2006 by Aaron Voisine and it is distributed under the
terms of the MIT license.

The power user David "Bailopan" Anderson (see www.bailopan.net) found many bugs
in Pawn, and provided patches and detailed reports. He and his team also
provided a new "memory file" module that make the compiler process large scripts
quicker.

Greg Garner from Artran Inc. compiled the source files as C++ files (rather
than C), added type casts where needed and fixed two bugs in the Pawn compiler
in the process. Greg Garner also wrote (and contributed) the extension module
for floating point support (files FLOAT.CPP and FLOAT.INC). I am currently
maintaining these modules, in order to keep them up to date with new features
in the Pawn toolkit.

Dieter Neubauer made a 16-bit version of the Pawn tools (meaning that a cell
is 16-bit, instead of the default 32-bit). His changes were merged in the
original distribution. Note that fixed or floating point arithmetic will be
near to impossible with a 16-bit cell.

Robert Daniels ported Pawn to ucLinux and corrected a few errors that had to
do with the "Endianness" of the CPU. His corrections make the Pawn compiler
and abstract machine better portable to Big Endian machines.

Frank Condello made a port of the Pawn toolkit to MacOS (CFM Carbon). His
changes are merged into the main source trunk.
